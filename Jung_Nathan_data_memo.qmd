## Instructions

After selecting data for the final project write up a short memo that at minimum covers the following:

### Data source

Identify and describe your data source or sources --- citations would be appropriate. Citations should include a hyperlink to the data source so that I can click on it to view the site. You should also demonstrate that you can import and work with the data by providing a simple `skim` of the data.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
All my data sources will be coming from the following [source](https://ourworldindata.org/obesity). This website has multiple datasets regarding obesity and its underlying factors, as well as explanations for where and how its data was sourced. I will be using several datasets from this specific site in order to create my graphic. A demonstration of just one of the datasets is shown below.

Ritchie, Hannah, and Max Roser. "Obesity." Our World in Data, August 11, 2017. <https://ourworldindata.org/obesity>.
:::

```{r}
colnames(obese_adults)[4] = 'Obesity_Percentage'
skim(obese_adults)
```

The skim shows zero missing observations in the dataset that need to be worried about.

```{r}
obese_adults %>% 
  summary()
```

The basic summary of the data shows that the highest obesity percentage is 60.70% and the lowest obesity percentage is 0.10% throughout the entire time period this dataset spans.

```{r}
obese_adults %>% 
  filter(Year == 2016) %>% 
  summarize(Year = 2016,
            min = min(Obesity_Percentage),
            median = median(Obesity_Percentage),
            max = max(Obesity_Percentage),
            mean = mean(Obesity_Percentage))
```

In the most recent year of the dataset, however, we find that the lowest obesity percentage is 2.1%, with the highest being, once again, 60.7%.

### Why this data

The reason for your choice of data. Is it interesting to you? Challenging? Is this part of a larger research project? State any questions of interest that might be motivating your choice of data. Include any other motivations or background that you believe to be relevant.

In general, we are asking you to tell us what sorts of questions you are trying to answer or what story you are trying to convey. Maybe you are just exploring a topic that is interesting to you and you are prospecting for a story to tell and that is okay too.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I chose this data because it is a topic that interests me as one who used to be a part of this demographic. I would find it interesting to see which countries have a particularly high obesity rate compared to others, as well as which countries are outliers in their obesity rate with respect to similar countries. I think it would be interesting to first look generally at which countries have the highest obesity rates, then find which countries have abnormally high obesity rates with respect to a certain variable, and then take a deeper look into those certain countries and potentially investigate certain variables that may potentially be related to those rates.
:::

### Visualization plan

Share your plan for visualizing the data. Are you going with a presentation and static graphics, presentation with a mix animated and static graphics, or will you attempt to build an app/dashboard?

This is just an initial plan and you don't have to stick to it.

::: {.callout-note appearance="'minimal"}
I will attempt to build an app/dashboard. I feel that will be the best possible way to allow people to investigate the data for themselves to find anything that may be of interest. I will still be able to tell a story with the specific countries/regions that are displayed in the data, but the app/dashboard will allow the user to switch between certain variables that I think would result in an overall better experience
:::

### Initial data issues

Have you been able to examine the data a little? If yes, have you spotted any potential issues like difficult data wrangling or data quality issues such as a significant amount of missing data?

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
I have examined the data, albeit in csv form. However, most of the data is quite similar to each other, as all the data in the site shares the same format. This makes possible data merging/wrangling an easy task, which is great considering that the data I will want to include in my graphics will come from many different csv files. Luckily, at least with this particular topic, there does not appear to be any significant amounts of missing data.
:::

### Misc

Students are encourage to add any other information that they think would be useful to communicate about their data and their plan.

If are seeking permission to work with a partner or partners then you should indicate it at the top of this memo (add a new section). Should include how you plan to work together or why working together makes sense for the project.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The site in question that I will be using will have other datasets on other topics that I will potentially incorporate into my own graphics. Given that the site is the main hub for all the datasets I will be using, I figured that only one link to the obesity dataset would be sufficient, especially since a simple search would give every single dataset I will be using in this project.
:::

### Demonstration of organization (optional)

It would also be nice, but not required for this memo, to include proof that you are following good data science practice by using a RStudio project for your final project with your data inside a `data/` subdirectory. You can do this by including a screenshot/picture, easiest way is to go to Visual mode and insert picture.
